# Fixing acidic tasting foods
Today, I messed up. I was sauteing some peppers and onions to go with the sausage I was making for dinner. Everything was going good as I was folowing the recipe to a 'T'. The last step for the peppers and onions was to add in some red wine vinegar to add some extra flavor.

The problem was, however, that I added WAY too much extra flavor. As I set aside the pepper/onion mixture, I couldn't help but notice the intense vinegar scent that had taken over my kitchen. 'Shit' I thought, the last 25 minutes of preparation and cooking for this went down the drain. I went back to the recipe to see the quantity of RWV I needed. I thought I added the correct amount, but when looking at the measuring spoon I had on the counter I realized I used 2 tablespoons instead of 2 teaspoons. Huge difference, right? I decided to taste them, and it was even worse than expected. There's no way that was acceptable. I accepted defeat, but before I threw them out I was curious if there was anything I could do to fix this mistake.

It turns out, there are a few ways to neutralize foods that have an overpowering vinegar taste to them. Two of these are using small amounts of salt or baking soda, which will balance out the acidic flavor. I opted for salt, because baking soda just didn't seem right on food, even though it's flavorless.

Now, we're talking VERY small amounts of these things. Like I gently sprinkled salt from the shaker over the mixture, then stirred it up. I sampled the mixture once more and it was way better than I'd have expected. In fact, it was really freaking awesome. Katie loved it and the meal was a success.

PS: Why in the hell are tablespoons and teaspoons so close? Like the abbreviations are one letter off. I know Im not the first person in the world to make this mistake. I can't help but wonder why there hasn't been a change in the naming standards. There's gotta be a cool story behind this!
