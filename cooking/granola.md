# Making the perfect granola
I believe that I have perfected my base granola recipe. The ingredients I've been using haven't changed, but I'm trying a new technique to make it the perfect texture. Granola is best served in a very chunky, clustery form (at least in my opinion). But the first few batches I made was very loose and a not easy to eat when dry. So, I used the same [basic granola recipe from Chowhound](http://www.chowhound.com/recipes/basic-granola-30062) but mixed up the process in order to create more clusters in my granola.

First off, when putting the raw granola mixture on the baking sheet, I make sure to compact it tightly. This helps with some initial clumping during the first 15 minutes of baking.

Then, when I took it out the first time to stir, I made sure I again packed it down to help the oats bind to eachother on the second round in the oven.

Lastly, I disregarded the instructions in the recipe to stir occasionally while the granola is cooling. This is the step that really creates a more cereal-like granola. Instead, I once again compacted the mixture together right when it came out of the oven, then left it alone for 20 minutes. At this point, it has cooled enough and become hardened. Stirring it all up now creates the large clusters that I enjoy and are perfect for snacking or mixing with a little bit of milk.

There you have it! You're armed with the recipe and techinque to make the greatest granola know to man. Make sure to mix in some other delicious goodies to really make some outta this world granola!
