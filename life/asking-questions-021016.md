# Don't be afraid to ask questions
I messed up. Big time. I thought I new how I needed to do something, but boy was I wrong. Part of it was being too comfortable for my own good, but part of it was because I was too scared to ask a simple question.

What I did isn't really important, but I think its valuable to note the root cause of the problem. I was trying to do something at work, and I had an idea of how to accomplish it but I was 100% sure. Instead of running my idea by an experienced co-worker, I decided to go ahead and just do it. The result was 4 hours of work by said coworker to clean up the mess I made. And all of it would have been prevented if I'd just taken the two minutes to shout over the wall of my cubicle to ask them their opinion.

I was and still am ashamed. They lost half a days work of their time working with me to figure it out. They were awesome, so patient and so kind. But I can't help to think that it could happen any time, to anyone. We all do things daily that we are unsure of. We THINK we know what's going to result from an action, but we really can't say for sure. And instead of communicating our concerns with others, we just push through and do it. This, in turn, may create more work for ourselves and/or others.

If we take the time to talk it out, a better solution may surface, or maybe we confirm that we were indeed correct in our thinking. Either way, the outcome is most likely more certain now that it was previously, all because we were deliberate in our actions. This is how we learn to be better.

Now I realize that you can't of course do this with everything. Sometimes, we as humans just need to fail. Failure makes us better, as we have an experience to learn from. But sometimes, trial and error is VERY costly. When making a decision that has potentially negative implications, you should confide in others. Take a moment to remove yourself from the situation. Ask yourself 'Who else is affected by this?' because if something goes wrong, those are the people getting dragged into a mess.

Personally, I know I need to ask more questions. It's something I've always been afraid of doing. I feel like I'm being a bother, but the reality is that the two minute talk is much less so than taking up hours of someones time because you didn't have the courage to ask.
