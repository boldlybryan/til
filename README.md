# Today I Learned
Just some things I learn on any given day.
This repo is where I'm going to stick anything interesting/insightful/useful that I learn in a day. It could be related to development or maybe just realizations about life that cross my mind. Anything is fair game.

I may not post something every single day, but there may also be times I add multiple items here. I hope to track my personal growth over time in the form of the knowledge and wisdom I accumulate.

I'm thinking about setting up a site that regenerates every time I push changes to this repo. It'll be a good exercise to practice my Git workflow and LEARN NEW THINGS.
